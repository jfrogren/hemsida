[Artikel i Guardian](https://archive.fo/UB2Wz) om ateistbloggaren Avijit Roy där bilden målas upp av honom som: "not just a person... he was a movement". 

> Our aim is to build a society which will not be bound by the dictates of arbitrary authority, comfortable superstition, stifling tradition, or suffocating orthodoxy but would rather be based on reason, compassion, humanity, equality and science.

— Avijit Roy (1972-2015)
