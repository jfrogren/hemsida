### Ornette Colemans tolkning:

> 'Embraceable You' from This is Our Music is probably the ultimate Rorschach test for Ornette’s fans and skeptics. I sympathize with anyone not being able to get next to it because I didn’t always like it either!

> These days I no longer hear the form as constantly getting lost, but instead as a through-composed collective improvisation. <br> &ensp; Ornette uses pure melody to shape his solo. Haden is right there, abstracting the tune’s changes and humbly serving Ornette’s broken-hearted smear. Blackwell’s mallets are perfect, especially if you can withhold judgement about the time warp during the first time he uses patterns on the toms. <br> &ensp; The searing, Coleman-composed introduction may be better than the Gershwin tune. It’s a performance that requires compassion to be understood.
