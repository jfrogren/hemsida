Daniel Trilling skriver tankvärt [om flyktingkrisen](https://archive.fo/w4n6s) i senaste numret av LRB:

> People develop attachments to places, they move, they develop attachments to new places, and to new people. If you think people have a right to do that, then the question is how to support it. If you don’t, then you need to ask yourself: what level of violence are you prepared to tolerate to keep people in their place?
